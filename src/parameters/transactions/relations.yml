  Specifies additional data about the transaction to return.
  
  Additional data may include merchant details (if the transaction occurred at a merchant) or
  categorisation of the transaction. Additional data is derived from the plain transaction data
  and may not be available immediately after a transaction appears in Pineapple.
  
  Loading additional data increases processing time, and may not be necessary depending on a
  client's requirements. By requesting only the additional data needed, a client can make the
  tradeoff between wait times and what is needed by the client.
